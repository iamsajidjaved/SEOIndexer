# SEOIndexer

SEOIndexer is a PHP-based tool built with Laravel to help website owners and developers improve search engine indexing. It fetches URLs from WordPress sitemaps and submits them to IndexNow-compatible search engines (like Bing, Yandex, and others) to ensure your content is quickly discovered and indexed.

## Features
- **Fetch Sitemaps**: Automatically retrieves URLs from WordPress sitemaps and saves them as JSON files for each domain.
- **Submit to IndexNow**: Sends URLs one-by-one to multiple IndexNow-compatible search engines, including Bing, Yandex, Naver, Seznam, Yep, and IndexNow Official.
- **Configurable**: Uses a simple configuration file to manage multiple websites, their sitemaps, and IndexNow API keys.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for HTTP requests and XML parsing, with clear console messages to help troubleshoot issues.

## Requirements
To use SEOIndexer, ensure your system meets these requirements:
- **PHP**: Version 8.0 or higher
- **Laravel**: Version 8.x or higher
- **Guzzle HTTP Client**: Included with Laravel for making HTTP requests
- **Storage Configuration**: Laravel's `public` disk must be configured for storing JSON files

## Installation
Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up SEOIndexer on your system:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command to download the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamsajidjaved/SEOIndexer
   cd SEOIndexer
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required PHP packages using Composer (ensure Composer is installed on your system):
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment File**  
   Laravel uses a `.env` file to configure settings. If the `.env` file doesn't exist, copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and ensure the `FILESYSTEM_DISK` is set to `public`:
   ```
   FILESYSTEM_DISK=public
   ```
   If you make changes, save the file.

4. **Generate Application Key**  
   Run the following command to generate a unique application key for Laravel:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Set Up the Configuration File**  
   The project requires a `config/indexnow.php` file to specify your websites, sitemaps, and IndexNow keys. Follow these steps:
   - **Check if `config/indexnow.php` Exists**: Navigate to the `config` directory in your project folder (`SEOIndexer/config`). If `indexnow.php` exists, proceed to edit it. If it doesn't exist, create it:
     ```bash
     touch config/indexnow.php
     ```
   - **Edit or Add Content**: Open `config/indexnow.php` in a text editor and add your site details. Below is an example configuration:
     ```php
     <?php

     return [
         [
             'domain' => 'www.example.com',
             'indexnow_key' => 'your-indexnow-key',
             'sitemaps' => [
                 'https://www.example.com/post-sitemap.xml',
                 'https://www.example.com/page-sitemap.xml',
             ],
         ],
     ];
     ```
   - **Obtain an IndexNow Key**: For detailed instructions on generating an IndexNow key, visit [Bing's IndexNow Get Started Guide](https://www.bing.com/indexnow/getstarted).
   - **Notes**:
     - Replace `www.example.com` with your website's domain.
     - Replace `your-indexnow-key` with the key obtained from Bing or another IndexNow provider.
     - Add multiple site configurations in the array if you manage multiple websites.

## Usage
SEOIndexer provides two main console commands to fetch and submit URLs. Run these commands in your terminal from the project root directory.

### 1. Fetch Sitemaps
This command retrieves URLs from the sitemaps listed in `config/indexnow.php` and saves them as JSON files:
```bash
php artisan indexnow:fetch-sitemaps
```
- **What Happens**: The command fetches URLs from each sitemap, removes duplicates, and stores them in `storage/app/public/indexnow/{domain}.json` (e.g., `storage/app/public/indexnow/www.example.com.json`).
- **Output**: The terminal shows progress, including the number of URLs fetched and any errors encountered.

### 2. Submit URLs to IndexNow
This command submits the URLs stored in the JSON files to IndexNow-compatible search engines:
```bash
php artisan indexnow:submit
```
- **What Happens**: The command reads the JSON files, validates each URL, and sends them individually to search engines like Bing, Yandex, Naver, and others.
- **Output**: The terminal displays success or failure messages for each URL submission, helping you track the process.

## Commands
- **`indexnow:fetch-sitemaps`**: Fetches URLs from sitemaps and saves them to JSON files in the `storage/app/public/indexnow` directory.
- **`indexnow:submit`**: Submits URLs from the JSON files to IndexNow search engines using individual GET requests.

## File Structure
Key files in the project:
- `app/Console/Commands/FetchSitemaps.php`: Handles fetching and parsing sitemaps to extract URLs.
- `app/Console/Commands/SubmitToIndexNow.php`: Manages submitting URLs to IndexNow endpoints.
- `config/indexnow.php`: Configuration file where you define site domains, sitemaps, and API keys.

## Notes
- **Storage Configuration**: Ensure the `public` disk is properly set up in `config/filesystems.php`. The default configuration should work, but verify that the `public` disk points to `storage/app/public`.
- **Supported Search Engines**: The tool submits URLs to Bing, Yandex, Naver, Seznam, Yep, and IndexNow Official.
- **URL Validation**: URLs are checked for validity before submission to prevent errors.
- **Console Feedback**: Commands provide detailed logs to help you monitor progress and debug issues.

## TODO
Future enhancements planned for SEOIndexer:
- Integrate Google Indexer API to support Googleâ€™s indexing services.
- Add Ping-O-Matic integration for pinging services to notify search engines and aggregators of new content.
- Integration with Buffer.com, etc.
